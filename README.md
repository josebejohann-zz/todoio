TodoIO is a React application to manage daily tasks.

---
### Running application
Start by clonning the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/josebejohann/todoio.git todoio
```
Then, move to our fresh new project folder:
```shell
cd todoio
```
Install all dependencies:
```shell
yarn
```
Finally, all you need to do is:
```shell
yarn start
```
A new browser tab will show up running the application on port 3000! =)
